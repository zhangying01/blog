# 你不知道的Go packages和功能

The previous chapter talked about developing and using custom data structures like linked
lists, binary trees, and hash tables, as well as generating random numbers and difficult-toguess passwords in Go and performing matrix operations.


上一章讲解了如何开发和如何自定的数据结构，如：linked lists、binary trees、hash table。用Go语言生成随机数和密码、执行高性能的矩阵操作等。

The main focus of this chapter is Go packages, which are the Go way of organizing,
delivering, and using code. The most common components of a Go package are functions,
which are pretty flexible in Go. Additionally, this chapter will talk about Go modules,
which are packages with versions. In the last part of this chapter, you will see some
advanced packages that belong to the Go standard library in order to better understand
that not all Go packages are created equal.

这章主要的重点是Go packages，它是用Go的方式组织、交付、使用代码。最重要的通用组件就是Go package中的函数，它使得在Go语言中变得可扩展。紧接着，这章将会讲解Go modules，这是带有版本号的Go packages。在这章的最后，你将了解一些属于Go标准库的packages，为了更好的理解Go packages的不同的创建方式。

In this chapter, you will learn about the following topics:

- Developing functions in Go
- Anonymous functions
- Functions that return multiple values
- Giving names to the return values of a function
- Functions that return other functions
- Functions that get other functions as parameters
- Variadic functions
- Developing Go packages
- Developing and working with Go modules
- Private and public package objects
- The use of the init() function in packages
- The sophisticated html/template standard Go package
- The text/template standard package, which is another truly sophisticated Go package that has its own language
- The go/scanner, go/parser, and go/token advanced packages
- The syscall standard Go package, which is a low-level package that, although you might not use it directly, is extensively used by other Go packages


本章，你将学到以下主题：
- go函数开发
- 匿名函数 
- 多返回值函数
- 命名函数返回值
- 函数返回其他函数
- 可变参数函数
- 开发Go packages
- 用Go Modules开发和工作
- 私有和公有package对象
- 在packages使用`init()`函数
- Go标准包html/template
- Go标准包text/template
- Go高级包go/scanner, go/parser, go/token
- Go标准包syscall，底层包，虽然你可能不直接使用，但是它广泛运用在其他的Go packages
